# ASS Photo Editor Pro

ASS Photo Editor Pro is a fully custom-built Windows desktop photo editing application, developed using C# and WPF (XAML). Designed as part of a Software Engineering and Information Systems project at Khulna University, this app showcases our ability to build a full-fledged image editor from scratchâ€”without relying on any external libraries. Every feature, from image manipulation to user interface design, has been implemented using our own logic and code.
